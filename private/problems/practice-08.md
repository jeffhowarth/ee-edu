__PRACTICE 8__ 

# __*swipe map app (2)*__  

## __goal__  

Please publish an app that supports your EO article. From the snapshots that you made in lab this week, please select two images and make an app that allows the reader to investigate changes between these two snapshots. 

The layout for your app should resemble the one from [Practice 07](../problems/practice-07.md). It should also differ in the following ways:  

* use images from the Landsat collection (rather than NAIP),  
* make a false color image that uses a SWIR (sometime called mid-IR) band,
* in your narrative, include a spectral signature chart and explain why your choice of false color helps distinguish different types of landcover in your two images when compared to natural color. 

## __resources__  

Here are some pages to help you with this problem:  

* [natural and false color images](../patterns/RGB-composites.md#natural-and-false-color)   
* [chart spectral signatures from Landsat](../patterns/RGB-composites.md#chart-spectral-signatures)
* [swipe map with side bar layout](../patterns/ui-design.md#swipe-map-with-side-bar-layout)

## __requirements__  

To receive full credit, your app should include: 

1. A swipe map with natural and false color images of your study region at two different times (each labeled with a date).    
2. A side bar that contains:  
    1. A catchy title that sparks interest. _OK if this is same as EO article._
    2. A subtitle that describes where and when. 
    3. A link to a __*short*__ narrative. 
    4. A byline credit. 
    5. A select widget that zooms the reader to at least three predefined places of interest that show different land cover types (and allows the user to zoom out to full extent).   
    6. Two checkbox widgets that allow the user to change the visibility of the layers in each map.  
3. The __*short*__ (200-500 words) narrative linked to the map should include:  
    1. A link to the EO story your app supports.
    2. The dates of the two images that your app shows.
    3. A spectral signature chart that shows at least three land cover types. (_The chart can be drawn from one image. Your goal is to explain how the false color works based on the bands in your false color image_.)
    4. A clear description of the spectral bands that you used to create your false color composite:  
        * What band (part of spectrum) is displayed with Red color channel?
        * What band (part of spectrum) is displayed with Green color channel?
        * What band (part of spectrum) is displayed with Blue color channel?
    5. A short explanation of the spectral signature chart:  
        * When compared to natural color, why does your choice of false color help distinguish the landcover types shown in your chart?  
    6. Your data sources and references if applicable.

## __delivery__  

Please complete the script, publish the app, and deliver this work <mark>by 5pm on Friday 11/8</mark>. To deliver, please complete the check up on Canvas (_available by Thurs morning_) where you will find a form that allows you to submit links to both your script and your app. 

Please note: this assignment will be manually checked, therefore you will not have the opportunity to make corrections to your script after you submit your links.  

But please also note: you can continue to change the narrative that is linked to your app after Friday and I will not be able to tell.
