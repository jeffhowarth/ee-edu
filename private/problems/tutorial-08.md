__TUTORIAL 8__ 

# __*Landsat snapshots*__  

## __goal__  

This tutorial aims to introduce you to workflows for processing and displaying earth observation data collected by Landsat missions over the last forty years.    

Your practical goal is to gather and process a time series of snapshots that use data collected by Landsat missions to show change in a place over time. In the practice problem this week, you will use this data to make an app the shows and explains these changes.  

## __instructions__  

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Choose a study location. 
    1. Review the [World of Change](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change){target=_blank} stories on Earth Observatory.  
    2. Pick a story location to investigate. The story should use RGB composites from Landsat to show changes to the Earth's surface over the last forty or so years.  
2. Collect snapshots from Landsat collections  
    1. Make a new folder in your repository called "Tutorial-08".
    2. Use the Landsat starter scripts to create a series of scripts where each script captures one image at a different time. 
    3. Please make at least one image with data from each Landsat mission (5,7,8,9).  _Note: even if the story that you selected from EO only shows two snapshots, please collect at least one image from each Landsat mission. I would like you to understand differences between the missions and how this can affect their use._
3. By <mark>5pm today (11/4)</mark>, please complete the Canvas quiz for Tutorial 08.
