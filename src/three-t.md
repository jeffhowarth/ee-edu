# __the three Ts__  

Writing geospatial workflows brings together three domains:  

1. __Thematic__: the vocabulary, concepts, principles, theories, etc. of your _application domain_; the academic discipline, professional context, etc that defines the terms and beliefs of your inquiry.  

2. __Technical__: the concepts and methods of the geographic information software that you are using to develop your workflows. For example, Google Earth Engine Javascript API, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, GDAL, etc.

3. __Theoretical__: the timeless concepts and methods of geospatial analysis and cartography; the body of knowledge that you need to understand to solve geospatial problems regardless of the thematic or technical domains that you are working in.

## __conceptual models__  

A key idea in geospatial workflows is that you can represent the world as a series of map layers for computation and comparison. So it is helpful to become familiar with the relatively small set of __conceptual models__ that geospatial workflows tend to employ as instruments for representing the world as map layers.

## __data models__  

When you develop geospatial workflows, your recurring task is to move between conceptual models and data models. In other words, you conceptualize a way to represent geography and then you implement this concept with a data model.
