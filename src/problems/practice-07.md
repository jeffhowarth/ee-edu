# __*wipe map app*__  

## __goal__  

Please publish an app that allows a user to investigate land cover change based on the plan that you developed in the tutorial this week.  

Your script should resemble the app below, but should be focused on your chosen study region. Ideally, you will be able to include the app in your portfolio of college work.

## __requirements__  

To receive full credit, your app should include: 

1. A wipe map with natural and false color images of your study region at two different times.    
2. A side bar that contains:  
    1. A catchy title that sparks interest.
    2. A subtitle that describes where and when. 
    3. A link to a short narrative. 
    4. A byline credit. 
    5. A select widget that takes the user to at least five predefined places of interest (and allows the user to zoom out to full extent).   
    6. Two checkbox widgets that allow the user to change the visibility of the layers in each map.  
3. The short narrative linked to the map should describe:  
    1. Where is your study region?
    2. Why did you choose this region?
    3. What are the dates of the two images?
    4. What places in your select widget show changes that reflect differences in the time of year that your two images were collected? 
    5. What places in your select widget show longer-term changes in the place?  
    6. What are your data sources?
